            "Autumn Blaze":"I'd like to say 'thank you' to all of the people involved with the creation and maintenance of the PonySquare site for allowing me to connect myself to a very diverse community of amazing people across the globe, along with another 'thank you' to those very people I have connected with out of character, or perhaps bonded with during roleplaying sessions.\nMy efforts to be a friend and a comfort to all of you have certainly not been in vain. I feel very accomplished after a couple of years spending time with others on the site. What makes me the happiest as of now is that I was able to make others happy and to know I did what I could do for them on an individual scale. Although I am honored to be in the top position, and I accept my place in the PonySquare Hall of Fame with gratitude and pride, I don't see this as accurately labeling me as the 'friendliest user'.\nMy runners-up have also shown an incomparable and un-rankable display of the true values of friendship and peace to the world. Aside from even them, I've met dozens of users who have made my life many times better simply for being there, and standing by me through my troubles, and feeling with me through my joy. I am simply trying to do the same for them.\nI'm extremely glad and relieved that many collectively think of me as a safe and warm person in their lives. I sought to be a true, true friend to everyone, and to show them the friendly love that they need to feel. The fact is clearer than ever to me that I have succeeded, in a way, at becoming this. Although it's true I have lost friends, especially through the site's shutdown, I will strive to become a role-model, and move on to start a new chapter in my life. I hope that in the future, I can keep making others' lives better, as they do for mine.\nThank you all, may these next sites treat us well, and may your beloved lives be bright, for yourself and others."
